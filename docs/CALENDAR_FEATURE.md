# Calendar Event Creation Feature

## Overview

The calendar event feature allows users to create calendar events instantly through voice commands. The implementation **directly creates calendar events** in the device's calendar database without opening any UI, providing immediate event creation.

## Voice Command Examples
- "Create a calendar event for tomorrow at 3 PM meeting with John"
- "Schedule a doctor appointment for December 25th at 10:30 AM"
- "Add a meeting for next week at 2:30"

## Working Implementation

The system uses **DirectCalendarEventIntent** which:
1. âœ… **Directly writes to Android Calendar Provider** - No UI interruption
2. âœ… **Auto-selects best available calendar** - Prefers visible, syncing calendars
3. âœ… **Converts natural language to timestamps** - AI calculates epoch milliseconds
4. âœ… **Creates events instantly** - Events appear in calendar apps immediately

## How It Works

1. **User Command**: "Create a calendar event for tomorrow at 3 PM meeting with John"
2. **AI Processing**: Agent calculates timestamps (e.g., tomorrow 3 PM = 1728054000000 epoch ms)
3. **Direct Creation**: `DirectCalendarEventIntent` writes directly to Calendar Provider
4. **Instant Result**: Event appears in calendar apps immediately

### Agent Action Format
```json
{
  "launch_intent": {
    "intent_name": "CalendarEvent", 
    "parameters": {
      "title": "meeting with John",
      "start_time": 1728054000000,
      "end_time": 1728057600000
    }
  }
}
```

### Calendar Selection Logic
The system automatically selects the best calendar:
1. Scans all calendars with write access (ACCESS_LEVEL â‰¥ 700)
2. Prefers calendars that are visible AND syncing 
3. Falls back to any writable calendar if needed
4. Logs selected calendar for debugging

## Permissions Required
- `READ_CALENDAR`: Access calendar information  
- `WRITE_CALENDAR`: Create calendar events
- Automatically requested during onboarding

## Key Implementation Details

### DirectCalendarEventIntent.kt
- Uses Android CalendarContract.Events.CONTENT_URI
- Writes directly to Calendar Provider database
- **Critical Fix**: Cannot set `VISIBLE` field (provider-only restriction)
- Auto-detects best calendar (visible + syncing)
- Sends broadcast to notify calendar apps of changes

### System Prompt Integration  
- Added `<calendar_rules>` to prevent Google searches for timestamps
- Agent calculates epoch milliseconds directly
- No more `search_google` for "milliseconds since epoch" conversions

### Enhanced Debugging
- Logs all available calendars with properties
- Verifies event creation with database queries  
- Tracks calendar selection reasoning

## Testing Results âœ…

**Voice Command**: "Create a calendar event for tomorrow at 3 PM meeting with John"

**Logs Show**:
```
DirectCalendarEvent: Available calendars:
DirectCalendarEvent: Calendar: 'jmnboy136@gmail.com' (ID: 3, Access: 700, Visible: 1, Sync: 1)
DirectCalendarEvent: Selected calendar ID: 3
DirectCalendarEvent: Calendar event created successfully: meeting with John
AgentV2: Task completed successfully
```

**Result**: âœ… Event created instantly, appears in Google Calendar

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Removed VISIBLE field** - Fixed IllegalArgumentException
2. **Smart calendar selection** - Prefers visible, syncing calendars
3. **Direct database writes** - No UI interruption 
4. **Proper permissions** - READ_CALENDAR + WRITE_CALENDAR
5. **Agent training** - No more Google searches for timestamps

## Current Status: **WORKING** ðŸŽ‰

The calendar event feature is fully functional and creates events instantly without opening any UI.
