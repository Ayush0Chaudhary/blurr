# Notification Content Context Enhancement

## Overview
This enhancement addresses the request in Issue #220 to provide notification content context when triggers are executed. Previously, only the predefined trigger instruction was passed to the agent. Now, the actual notification content (title, text, and package) is included for better context.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced TriggerReceiver.kt
**New Constants Added:**
- `EXTRA_NOTIFICATION_TITLE` - For notification title
- `EXTRA_NOTIFICATION_TEXT` - For notification text content  
- `EXTRA_NOTIFICATION_PACKAGE` - For source package name

**New Method:**
- `buildEnhancedInstruction()` - Combines trigger instruction with notification content

### 2. Enhanced PandaNotificationListenerService.kt
**Notification Content Extraction:**
- Extracts title from `notification.extras.getCharSequence("android.title")`
- Extracts text from `notification.extras.getCharSequence("android.text")`
- Passes content via intent extras to TriggerReceiver

## Example Usage

### Before Enhancement
**Trigger:** "Check my messages"
**Agent receives:** "Check my messages"

### After Enhancement  
**Notification:** WhatsApp notification with title "New Message" and text "Hello from John"
**Trigger:** "Check my messages"
**Agent receives:** "A notification was received from com.whatsapp with title: \"New Message\" and content: \"Hello from John\". Check my messages"

## Implementation Details

### Context Building Logic
The enhanced instruction is built as follows:
```
"A notification was received [from {package}] [with title: \"{title}\"] [and content: \"{text}\"]. {original_instruction}"
```

- Gracefully handles missing content (title-only, text-only, or no content)
- Falls back to original instruction if no notification content available
- Properly escapes quotes in notification content

### Logging
Enhanced logging shows both original and enhanced instructions for debugging:
```
D/TriggerReceiver: Received task to execute: 'Check my messages'
D/TriggerReceiver: Enhanced instruction with notification context: 'A notification was received from com.whatsapp with title: "New Message" and content: "Hello from John". Check my messages'
```

## Testing
Unit tests verify the context building logic handles various scenarios:
- Complete notification content (title + text + package)
- Partial content (title only, text only)
- No notification content (fallback to original)

## Benefits
1. **Better Context:** Agent knows what notification triggered the task
2. **Smarter Responses:** Can reference specific notification content
3. **Backward Compatible:** Still works if no notification content available
4. **Flexible:** Handles various notification formats gracefully
