# Memory System Status

## Current Status: Temporarily Disabled

⚠️ **Panda memory is turned off as of yet.**

The memory functionality in Panda has been temporarily disabled while we work on improvements and optimizations. This means:

## What's Affected

- **Conversational Memory**: Panda will not remember information from previous conversations
- **Personal Information Storage**: No personal details will be stored or recalled
- **Learning from Interactions**: Panda won't learn from your preferences or habits
- **Memory Management UI**: The memories screen will show a disabled state

## Why Is Memory Disabled?

The memory system is being temporarily disabled to:
- Ensure optimal performance during development
- Implement enhanced privacy and security measures
- Rebuild the memory architecture for better reliability
- Focus on core conversation and task execution features

## What Still Works

- **Voice Conversations**: Full conversational capabilities remain available
- **Task Execution**: All automation and device control features work normally
- **Screen Understanding**: Panda can still see and interact with your screen
- **Real-time Context**: Current screen context is still processed for each interaction

## When Will Memory Return?

Memory functionality will be restored in a future update. We're working to make it:
- More accurate and reliable
- Better at understanding context
- More respectful of your privacy
- Faster and more efficient

## Current Workarounds

While memory is disabled:
- Provide context in each conversation when needed
- Use specific names and details in your requests
- Remember that Panda won't recall previous interactions
