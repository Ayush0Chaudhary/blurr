In this project you might find the GEMINI API key but that is for the gemini free tier which is free. 
Would recommend to get your own if you really wanna use this product. Prefer better model for better speed.

You can only run this in **ROOTED Android**, root your emulator if you wanna run this. Rooting phones is headache (i tried :()

I have added TTS module, but not really used, future plans to give my agent a voice. 

NOTE: In rooted phone, Playstore wont work, in recent youtube update, it also have stopped working.
